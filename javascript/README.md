### JavaScript Boilerplate
##### Up and running

This boilerplate project uses mocha as a test runner, sinon for stubbing and spies, chai for better assertions and instanbul for code coverage.

Grab the dependencies via `npm install` and then run `npm test` to run all specs with code coverage or `npm start` to fire the application up!
